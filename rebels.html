    Skip to Main Content" link
    -Use the position property 
    -focus pseudo-class
    -It should only be visible when the link is in focus.

    Style your navigation 
    - use at least three CSS properties.

    Style all images using the box model. 
    - At a minimum use border
    - padding
    - border-radius.

    Apply the grid property to at least one parent element. 
    - Use at least two columns

    Apply the flex property to at least one parent element The navigation bar is one place to use flex. You can also use it on images if you would like.

    Update at least one element using the hover pseudo-class. Make sure that the hover property does something interesting. I encourage you to do an internet search on some common transitions and try those.

    Implement the nth-child selector. In my example I used this on the flex page where I gave every other image a different border-radius. Don't forget, if you are styling an advanced selector it can be a little trickier to use the pseudo-classes. Work slowly and carefully. -->
